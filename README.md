# -Here-the-live-match-Volkanovski-vs-Lopes-UFC-314-In-April-

Miami The main event is for the vacant UFC featherweight title after Ilia Topuria vacated his belt to move up to 155 pounds. This fight is important for both fighters: Volkanovski trying to return to the title he once held, and Lopes hoping to win his first championship in the UFC.
Alexander Volkanovski's
Record and Recent Form: Volkanovski (26-4) is a former UFC featherweight champion who held the belt for more than four years and made five defenses. But he’s also returning from consecutive knockout defeats — the first to Islam Makhachev in October 2024, at lightweight, the second to Ilia Topuria in February 2024, at featherweight. It will be his first bout in more than a year after a recovery period of 14 months.
Motivation:​ Volkanovski is 36 years old and he understands that this is his last chance to get his belt back. He has adopted an “Old Man Volk” persona, determined to show he can still vie with the best in the game. But he remains confident in his ability to outmaneuver younger candidates with experience and tactical sensibilities.
Diego Lopes' Rise
Record and Momentum: Lopes (26-6) is on a five-fight winning streak, having defeated Dan Ige and Brian Ortega. A hard-hitting brawler, Lopes has climbed the featherweight ladder quickly after joining the UFC less than two years ago.
Fighting Style: A powerful striker complemented by elite level jiu-jitsu. But questions about his cardio persisted despite improving in his most recent fights.
Victory
For Volkanovski: Analysts believe Volkanovski has to use footwork and his dirty boxing strategy to break Lopes cardio. The key, of course, will be to avoid the early exchanges in which Lopes is at her most deadly — Volkanovski’s chin has been questioned following back-to-back defeats by knockout.
Lopes: Lopes needs to take advantage of Volkanovski’s recent woes by putting him on notice early and using his power. His capacity to blend striking with grappling could also create problems for Volkanovski.
Fight Highlights
UFC 314 features arguably the most stacked card of the year:
Co-Main Event: Michael Chandler vs. Paddy Pimblett, lightweight.
Other key fights are Yair Rodriguez vs. Patricio Pitbull (featherweight), Jean Silva vs. Bryce Mitchell (featherweight) and Geoff Neal vs. Carlos Prates (welterweight).
It’s a fight of eras: Volkanovski’s experience and legacy versus Lopes’ youthful trajectory and desire for gold. Divisional gold will be at stake, and perhaps more importantly, the winner will likely receive a career-defining boost that shapes their career moving forward.
